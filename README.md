## Question and Motivation
As our team formed, several topics of interest emerged. As the conversation around data access and utilization developed, we narrowed the scope of our final project to the aerospace and airline industry, specifically flight data concerning arrival delays. The question we are looking to answer is this - What factors influence the timeliness (especially delays) of commercial aircraft at major airports within the United States? We intentionally leave this research question broad, constraining it by the geographic scope and commercial flight sector. The approach we take to analyzing the dataset and constructing a predictive algorithm for flight delays aims at taking several factors into account, such as airline carrier, airport (and its corresponding flight volume), weather conditions, security conditions, and other delays due to ground operations. 
	A predictive model of this scope and focus is especially important as we head into the holiday travel season. It is no surprise that flight arrivals are prone to considerable delays as airports become saturated by seasonal traffic, often paired with unforecasted weather events. The ideal use of our model would be to explicitly define either an origin and terminal airport or an airline route and an accurate prediction of expected arrival delays would be calculated. Going even further, as a stretch goal, we may explore more meaningful reports of flight “health” beyond arrival delays. As an overall influence on passenger satisfaction and experience, however, we will start here.


## Background 
Flight delay prediction has become a significant focus in transportation and data science, given the impact of delays on passengers and airline operations. Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), have shown promising potential to model the complex temporal dependencies inherent in flight delay data.
Sundararaman and Kumar (2023) explored time-series analysis using deep learning techniques to predict flight delays. Their research underscores the influence of external factors, such as weather, on flight schedules, demonstrating that capturing sequential dependencies—like successive delays or extended adverse weather—enhances prediction accuracy. Their findings highlight the necessity of integrating diverse features to identify temporal patterns, establishing a foundation for our project to examine multiple external factors using RNNs (Sundararaman & Kumar, 2023).
Wang et al. (2016) proposed a hybrid model combining RNNs with traditional statistical algorithms to improve prediction accuracy. By blending statistical insights with RNNs' capability to manage sequential data, this approach addresses the limitations of purely statistical models, which often falter with complex, nonlinear relationships. Their study found that the hybrid model significantly outperformed simpler regression models in handling the multivariate complexities of flight delay prediction (Wang, Hu, & Lu, 2016).
Yhdego et al. (2023) applied a hybrid RNN model to investigate how inbound flight delays affect departures, especially for connecting passengers. This study captures the intricate dependencies of connection times, showing that even minor inbound delays can cascade to subsequent flights. Their work supports our interest in using RNNs to model cascading delays and interconnected dependencies across flights (Yhdego, Wei, Erlebacher, Wang, & Tejada, 2023).
Collectively, these studies underscore the effectiveness of RNNs in modeling temporal dependencies and complex interactions in sequential data. Sundararaman and Kumar's (2023) focus on external factors, Wang et al.'s (2016) hybrid model approach and Yhdego et al.'s (2023) exploration of delay propagation provide a robust foundation for our project. These insights affirm our choice of an RNN model, as it can more accurately capture the complex interrelations of factors affecting flight delays than simpler models.


## Data Source
The data source we are using has been found via Kaggle, a data science platform. The dataset, entitled Flight Delay Data, comprises data for the U.S. Airports by carrier August 2013 - August 2023. As defined by the metadata tag, this dataset provides detailed information on key metrics such as the number of arriving flights, delays over 15 minutes, cancellations, and diversions. There are 21 columns to this dataset - some of the most important being year, month, carrier_code, carrier_name, airport_code, arr_flights (number of arriving flights), and arr_del15 (number of flights delayed by 15 minutes or more. The rows of this dataset, of which there are over 170,000, each describe a single month for a single carrier at a single airport. For example, the first row of this dataset (most recent entry in time) describes statistics of all Endeavor Air (E9) flights through Allentown, PA (ABE) during August (8) of 2023. 
We will begin by conducting some exploratory data analysis to understand the breadth of the dataset and any patterns visible by simple visualizations (like histograms, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps). We may also filter the dataset, only maintaining columns and rows we see necessary for further model development. 


## Analysis Approach
Throughout this project we hope to garner a better understanding of how factors such as weather, time of year, and large events impact the flying experience. That experience encompasses factors such as flight delays, flight prices etc. We will first conduct a multiple regression model to get a sense of how much each variable impacts delay. Then, we plan to use a more precise approach, that is Tensorflow’s time series forecasting capabilities to build a recurrent neural network. Our hope is that this recurrent neural network, armed with the data we discussed in the previous section, will give us untapped insights into how these external factors affect the flight experience. The limitations of this approach lie in the complexity of the recurrent neural network. This model will require vast amounts of data and is quite complex. Cleaning and preparing that amount of data will be time-consuming. There will be a need to cobble various datasets together for flight delay, weather, and to factor in pricing data.
Recurrent neural networks’ propensity to handle sequential data, in particular time series data, long-term memory which allows us a look deep into the past, and the ability to handle multiple input features such as weather and time of year. We felt the need to employ a more complex model because of the many factors we hope to investigate. Simpler linear regression models assume a linear relationship and thus fail to account for the nuanced impact of our various internal and external factors. This supervised learning approach fits our analysis needs well enough to outweigh the complexity and greedy data concerns. We believe that the recurrent neural network approach allows us the best opportunity to discover the deep underlying relationship between external factors and flight delays.
